# Copy Ocelot

### Introduction

Our mission today is to copy one of the following websites:

- [eBay](https://www.ebay.com/)
- [Square](https://squareup.com/us/en)
- [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/)
- [Monster](https://www.monster.com/)
- [WordPress](https://wordpress.com/)
- [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/)
- [Lokai](https://lokai.com)
- [NY Times](https://www.nytimes.com/)
- [Medium](https://medium.com/)
- [GrubHub](https://www.grubhub.com/)

And you'll do it using Flexbox OR Grid. Your choice!

Or BOTH? Sure!

### But First, A Wireframe!

Before you begin, wireframe your site. What is wireframing? Glad you asked! Here is [a great, simple wireframing explainer](https://medium.com/swlh/a-5-minute-wireframing-tutorial-f84c36e86e79).

The first part of this assignment, due BEFORE you begin work on the actual assignment, is a wireframe plan of the whole front page. Again, **you must turn in the wireframe before you can begin on the assignment**.

Once you've got that, you can begin on the main assignment.

### Okay, But What Platform Do I Use For Wireframing?

- Paper and pen are actually GREAT for this. (Just take a photo with your phone to turn it in!)
- I like [excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (which the article above uses as well!). It's simple, getting you RIGHT into wireframing. Downside is that there's no cloud; you save and open files from your local machine. (Screenshot it to turn it in.)
- There are some other more "pro" solutions out there, like Figma, Invision, and Balsamiq. Check them out if you want a more share-able and collaborate-able wireframe in the future.

### Guidelines

- This will be a solo project.
- You _only_ have to copy the main page, but you _do_ have to copy past the opening viewport. In human speak: you need to copy all the way down to the bottom of the main page. Or as far down as you can get!
- Copy all text verbatim using copy-paste; if it's not selectable, take the equivalent amount of text from a lorem ipsum generator. Do _not_ screenshot it, as an image will respond differently to viewport changes than text will.
- But _do_ save or screenshot _images_.
- For videos, either link to the original video using a `video` tag, or simply screenshot the video and implement it as a still image.

### Stretch Goals

- Copy another page!
